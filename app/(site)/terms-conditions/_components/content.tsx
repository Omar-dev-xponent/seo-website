          </h2>

          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
            Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis. You
            will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis
            ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly or annual
            basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when
            purchasing a Subscription.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
            automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
            cancel it or Outreachful cancels it. You may cancel your
            Subscription renewal either through your online account management
            page or by contacting Outreachful customer support team.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
            A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to
            process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide
            Outreachful with accurate and complete billing information including
            full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid
            payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
            you automatically authorize Outreachful to charge all Subscription
            fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Outreachful
            Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must
            proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
            payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the
            invoice.

            If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the
            Free Trial, you will not be charged by Outreachful until the Free
            Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless
            you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged
            the applicable subscription fee for the type of Subscription you
            have selected.
