              From frustration to innovation
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
              Outreachful was born out of frustration. As SEO professionals
              ourselves, we were tired of juggling multiple tools, spreadsheets,
              and platforms to manage our link building campaigns.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
              In 2019, our founders Alex Chen and Sarah Johnson decided there
              had to be a better way. They set out to build the all-in-one link
              building platform they wished existedâ€”combining prospecting,
              outreach, and monitoring in one seamless tool.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
              What started as a simple tool for their own agency quickly gained
              attention from other SEO professionals. Today, Outreachful helps
              hundreds of agencies and in-house teams outreachful their link
              building process and achieve better results with less effort.
