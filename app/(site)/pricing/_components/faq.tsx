                Can I migrate my existing campaigns and prospect lists from
                other tools?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Yes! Outreachful offers several import options. You can bulk
                import prospect lists from CSV/Excel files, and our system will
                automatically enrich them with SEO metrics and contact data. For
                existing campaigns, you can import your templates, prospect
                statuses, and outreach history. Our support team can help with
                complex migrations from popular tools like Pitchbox, BuzzStream,
                or custom spreadsheet systems.

              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                When you connect your email accounts (Gmail, Outlook, or SMTP),
                Outreachful uses authenticated sending through official APIs
                rather than sending on your behalf. This means emails appear
                exactly as if you sent them directly from your inbox. We also
                implement smart sending limits, delivery timing optimization,
                and domain warming protocols to maintain your sender reputation.
                If you're sending high volumes, our system will automatically
                space out emails to avoid triggering spam filters.

              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Our monitoring system performs regular checks of all your placed
                backlinks (every 72 hours by default, but customizable). It
                detects various status changes including: complete removal,
                changed from dofollow to nofollow, addition of sponsored/UGC
                attributes, URL changes, and anchor text modifications. The
                system uses both direct HTML checking and header response
                analysis to minimize false positives. When a change is detected,
                you receive an immediate alert with the specific details of what
                changed.

                your data is securely deleted from our systems per our privacy
                policy. We never hold your data hostage - it's yours and you can
                take it with you.

                Absolutely. Each team member can connect their individual email

                controls. This allows your outreach specialists to send from
                their own professional email addresses, creating more personal
                connections with prospects. Team leaders can still access
                performance metrics and track all communications while team
                members maintain their individual sender identities.

                Reports can be scheduled to generate automatically and either be
                sent directly to clients or held for your review before sharing.
